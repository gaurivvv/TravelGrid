## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up **TravelGrid** locally and contribute to the project.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Git**
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adarsh-Chaubey03/TravelGrid.git
   cd TravelGrid
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

   > **Note**: If you encounter npm WARN deprecated or peer dependency errors, run:
   > ```bash
   > npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   > ```

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm install
   ```

   > **Note**: Ensure you are in the `server` folder. If you encounter an `ENOENT: no such file or directory` error, verify the folder structure.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend Server**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Start the Frontend**

   In a new terminal:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

   The client will run on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `npm ERR! enoent` | Verify you are in the correct folder (`client` or `server`) before running `npm install`. |
| Port already in use | Stop other applications using the port or modify the port in `vite.config.js` or the backend server configuration. |
| Dependency errors | Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` for the frontend. |
| Server not starting | Ensure the `.env` file contains the correct MongoDB URI and port settings. |
